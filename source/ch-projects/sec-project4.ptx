    <title>Project 4: Upside Down Snow Storm</title>
    
    <p>
        In this project, we will make a calm and relaxing visual of snowfall. The only catch is that the snowflakes will
        be falling up... so an upside down snow storm.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will explain what is going on, but vist <url href="https://www.online-python.com/" visual="online-python.com">Online-Python</url> and type the
        code in for yourself. Once complete, save the file and share with your instructor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keep in mind that program is not linear. Much like writing a story, a poem, or a mathematical proof, we will not
        think of the parts one at a time. We'll try to describe our thought process in the script to share the strategy behind
        writing a program.
    </p>


    <program language="python" line-numbers="yes">
        <code>
            import random, time

            open_message = """
            We will build an upside-down snowfall... meaning the snow flakes will fall upward!
            """
            print(open_message)
            
            intensity = input("How intense of a snowstorm do you want? 1-10 ")
            snow_count = int(intensity)
            
            
            
            while True:
                #Display our snow flakes
                row = " "*90
                for i in range(snow_count):
                    
                    flake = random.randint(0,len(row))
                    row = row[:flake] + '*' + row[flake+1:]
                    time.sleep(0.05)
                print(row)
        </code>
</program>

<p>
Now, just debug for syntax issues, and good luck against the bot!
