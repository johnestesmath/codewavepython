    <title>Your First Python Program</title>

    <p>
      Before you can turn the world upside down with coding, you have to start somewhere. We will start where most programmers start... 
      simply saying "hi" to the world.
    </p>

    <sage language="python">
      <input>
      print("hello world!")
      </input>
      </sage>

  <p>Excellent! Good job. We'll explain how this works </p>

    <title>Variables and Printing</title>

    <p>
      A variable is like a container that stores information. You can think of it like a labeled box that holds a value.

For example:
    </p>

    <sage language="python">
      <input>
      name = "Tonya"
      age = 14
      print(name)
      print(age)
      </input>
      </sage>

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>name</c> is a variable that stores a string: <c>Tonya</c>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>age</c> is a variable that stores a number: <c>15</c>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    
    </p>


    <activity xml:id="act-print-variables">
  <title>About Me</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Write a short "About Me" using variables and <c>print()</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <sage langue="python">
        <input>
          name = # What's your name?
          hobby = # What's your hobby?
          pet = # What's your pet name?
            
          print("My name is", name + ".")
          print("I love", hobby + ".")
          print("I have a pet", pet + ".")
        </input>      
    
    </sage>
  </p>
  </statement>

  <title>A Few Tips on Variable Naming</title>
There are a few rules when naming variables, and ignoring them can either cause code errors or make you code difficult to read. Here are a few guidelines:

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. However, variables CANNOT begin with a number.
      Valid: <c>_dog12</c>, <c>monkeyAndHisBanana</c>, <c>ti56_xd_5 </c>	Invalid: <c>48pythonRocker</c>       
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Variable names CANNOT include spaces. Valid: <c>orange_Cat</c>	Invalid: <c>orange Cat</c>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Variable names should be short, but be sure to give a good descriptive name.
  For example, <c>pet_name</c> is better than <c>p_n</c> or <c>the_name_of_my_pet</c>. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Variables are case sensitive: <c>red_rover</c>, <c>Red_Rover</c>, and <c>RED_rOvEr</c> are all different variable names.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-print-function">
    <title>Using the <c>print()</c> function </title>

    <p>
      We have already used the <c>print()</c> function, but what is it? Python’s <c>print()</c> function shows information on the screen. Revelutionary! </p>

      <p>With the <c>print()</c> function, we can display a message (called a string, which we will get to soon), a variable, mathematical calculations (soon!), and a combination of such things. </p>
    
      <p>
        <sage language="python">
          <input>
            print("Hello!")
          </input>
        </sage>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also print variables with text.
      </p>

      <p>
        <sage language="python">
          <input>
            name = "Michael"
            age = 23
            
            print("My name is", name)
            print("I am", age, "years old")
                        
          </input>
        </sage>
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice how a string like “My name is” and the variable interact within a print statement. Recall that the variable name is a label for something else, and Python recognizes that within the <c>print()</c> function.
