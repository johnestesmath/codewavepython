    <p>
        Where lists consist of elements in a given order, sometimes we may not care about the order of elements. 
        Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful when you need to eliminate duplicates or perform set operations.

    <remark>
        Sets in Python are just like sets you see in mathematics.

    <p>
    Given sets <c>a</c> and <c>b</c>, we can form new sets. The set "a union b" combines elements of two lists into one (without duplicates), and
    the set "a intersect b" is the list of elements that are in <c>a </c> and <c>b</c>.    
    </p>

    <p>
        <sage language="python">
            <input>
                a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {3, 4, 5}

print(a.union(b))      # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(a.intersection(b))  # {3}
print(a.difference(b))    # {1, 2}

            </input>
        </sage>
    </p>

    <p>
        We can also modify sets and their elements.
        <sage language="python">
            <input>
colors = {'blue','red'}
colors.add('yellow')
colors.remove('red')                     
            </input>
        </sage>
