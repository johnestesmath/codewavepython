    <title>Conditional Statements</title>
    
    <p>
        Conditional statements let you branch your codeâ€”only running certain blocks when specific conditions are met. We make
        these decisions through Boolean values. We'll look at the most common conditional statements: <c>if</c>, <c>if-then</c>,
        and <c>if-elif-else</c>
    </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-">
        <title>If Statements</title>
        
        <p>
            Let's look at an example.

            <sage language="python">
                <input>
                    age = 18
                    if age >= 18:
                        print("You can vote!")
                            
                </input>
            </sage>
            
        </p>

        <p>
            The code inside the <c>if</c> block only runs if the condition is True. In this case, we print "You can vote!" if the age is
            at least 18.
        </p>

            <p>
                Notice the indentation: Python uses indentation (typically 4 spaces) to define blocks of code. Generally speaking,
                (and you may have discovered this on your own already) Python is picky with indentation. Here, the indentation tells Python
                what all is considered to be in your <c>if</c> block.
