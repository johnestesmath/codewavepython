    <title>Mini Project: Mad-libs</title>
    
    <p>
    In this project, we will try to combine some of the things we have learned in this chapter. It's okay to make mistakes. Break some eggs!
    This is how we learn.

    Mad-libs has been a popular word game for decades! In this game, people select words to fill in a story. Usually, the words are out of 
    context, and the stories are funny. For example: </p>

    <p>
    “One day, a [adjective] [noun] decided to [verb] through the neighborhood.
Everyone stopped and stared, but no one could believe their eyes.
It was the start of something truly unforgettable.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Make your own mad-libs story with at least seven blanks (adjectives, nouns, verbs, adverbs, expressions, proper names, etc.). 
    Ask a user to input the different blanks (stored as variables), and then print the story with the user’s selected words.

    <p>
        We recommend 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    declaring your variables as inputs. For example <c>adjective1 = input("Give me an adjective: ")</c>,
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  write your story with an f-string. For example, <c>my_story = f'''This is an {adjective1} story.'''</c>,  
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    print your story with <c>print(my_story)</c>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
