    <title>Project 2: Hangman</title>
    
    <p>
        In this project, we will build a game of Hangman that two friends can. Here's the code in full.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will explain what is going on, but vist <url href="https://www.online-python.com/" visual="online-python.com">Online-Python</url> and type the
        code in for yourself. Once complete, save the file and share with your instructor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keep in mind that program is not linear. Much like writing a story, a poem, or a mathematical proof, we will not
        think of the parts one at a time. We'll try to describe our thought process in the script to share the strategy behind
        writing a program.
