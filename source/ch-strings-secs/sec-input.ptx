    <title>User Input</title>
    
    <p>
        A big part of programming involves asking the program's user for some sort of input.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    username and password
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    setting preferences
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    their favorite color
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        We can easily interact with a program user with <c>input()</c>. Use the <c>input()</c> function to ask the user a question and get their answer.
        Unfortunately, our embedded code cells do not support the <c>input()</c> function, but you can play with <c>input()</c> by visting <url href="https://www.online-python.com/" visual="online-python.com">Online-Python</url>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Try typing the following.
         </p>
        <program language="python">
            <code>
                name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name + "!")

            </code>
        </program>


    <remark>
        <p>
            The <c>input()</c> function always gives us (or returns) a string. If you want a number, convert it using <c>int()</c>
            or <c>float()</c>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try typing the following.
         </p>
        <program language="python">
            <code>
                age = input("How old are you? ")
                print("Next year, you will be", int(age) + 1)

            </code>
        </program>

    <p>
        Use <c>input()</c> is an exteremely valuable tool to add to your growing, programming toolkit!
