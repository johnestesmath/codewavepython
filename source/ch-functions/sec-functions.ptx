    <title>What is a Function? </title>

    <p>
        In mathematics, a function like <m>f(x) = x^2</m> is a way to assign output with a given input. For example,
        <m>f(3) = 3^2  = 9</m>. Functions are very useful in algebra, calculus, and so on. In programming, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
        Once you write a function, you can call it whenever you need it.
