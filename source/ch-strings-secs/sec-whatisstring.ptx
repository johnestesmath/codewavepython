    <title>What is a String?</title>   

<p>We already talked about strings. Remember that a string is a sequence of characters. 
    You can think of a string as any text inside quotes. As long as a statement has quotes <c>' '</c>, double quotes <c>" "</c>, or
    even triple quotes (<c>''' '''</c> or <c>""" """</c>), Python will recognize it as a string.
    <sage language = "python">
        <input>
            location = 'Mississippi'
            goodByeMessage = "Goodbye, my friend!"
        </input>
    </sage>

            How could we store "I'm eating Bobby's pizza."?
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            We could store just as is written! <c>message = "I'm eating Bobby's pizza."</c>

    <title>Multi-line Strings</title>

    <p>
        Sometimes we wish to include a lot of text as one string instead of many smaller strings. You can write strings that span multiple lines using triple quotes (<c>'''</c> or <c>"""</c>), and note we donâ€™t have   
    
    <sage language="python">
        <input>
            message = """Dear student,

Welcome to Python programming!
We hope you enjoy learning.

- Your Instructor
"""

print(message)

    <title>F-strings</title>

    <p>
        We've seen examples of how to include variables in the middle of a print statement. For example,

        <sage language="python">
            <input>
                favorite_fruit = "mango"
                
                print("My favorite fruit is " + favorite_fruit + " because" + favorite_fruit +"s are a good source of vitamins.")
            </input>
        </sage>

    </p>

    <p>
        
        However, this technique is not always convenient. Instead, f-strings make it easier to include variables in your text. Just add an <c>f</c> before the string 
        and put variables in <c>{}</c>.

        <sage language="python">
            <input>
                favorite_fruit = "mango"
vitamin="B"

print(f"My favorite fruit is {favorite_fruit}, because {favorite_fruit}s are a good source of vitamin {vitamin}.")

            </input>
        </sage>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can even do math inside an f-string:

        <sage language="python">
            <input>
            current_age = 18

            print(f"Today, I am {current_age} years old. In two years, I will be {current_age + 2} years old.")
            </input>
        </sage>
    </p>
    
</subsection>



<subsection xml:id="subsec-stringformat">
    <title>String Formatting</title>

    <p>
        We can also use <c>.format()</c>

    <sage language="python">
        <input>
            city = "New York"
weather = "sunny"

print("The weather in {} is {} today.".format(city, weather))

        </input>
    </sage>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also number the placeholders:
    
        <sage language="python">
            <input>
                print("My name is {0} and I live in {1}.".format("Taylor", "Chicago"))
            </input>
        </sage>
    </p>
