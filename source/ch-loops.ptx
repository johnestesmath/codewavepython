  <title>If-Thens and Loops</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> So far, you’ve learned how to work with variables, numbers, and strings. Now, we will learn how to 
      code decision making. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to make your programs think—by evaluating conditions and choosing what to do next. This is where control flow comes in.
      Python provides several powerful tools for control flow:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Booleans: The foundation of logic in programming
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Conditional statements: if, if-else, and if-elif-else
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Loops: for and while loops for repeating actions
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
     
      Let’s break it all down.
