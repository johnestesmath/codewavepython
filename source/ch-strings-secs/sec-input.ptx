    <title>User Input</title>
    
    <p>
        A big part of programming involves asking the program's user for some sort of input.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    username and password
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    setting preferences
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    their favorite color
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        We can easily interact with a program user with <c>input()</c>. Use the <c>input()</c> function to ask the user a question and get their answer.

        <sage language="python">
            <input>
                name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name + "!")

            </input>
        </sage>
    </p>

    <remark>
        <p>
            The <c>input()</c> function always gives us (or returns) a string. If you want a number, convert it using <c>int()</c>
            or <c>float()</c>.

            <sage language="python">
                <input>
                    age = input("How old are you? ")
print("Next year, you will be", int(age) + 1)

                </input>
            </sage>
        </p>

    <p>
        Use <c>input()</c> is an exteremely valuable tool to add to your growing, programming toolkit!

        Try the following exercises. Don’t be afraid of making errors. That’s how we learn.
    </p>

    <exercise>
        <title>Making Introductions</title>        
        <p>
            Ask a user for (1) their name, (2) their favorite animal, and (3) a place they would like to visit. Then summarize
            their answers with a sentence.

            <sage language="python">
                <input>
                    
                </input>
            </sage>
        </p>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
        Ask a user for a sentence. Then 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    convert the sentence to lowercase
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    count the number of times the letter 's' appears 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    replace all spaces with an underscore '_'
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    print the resulting sentence.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </exercise>
