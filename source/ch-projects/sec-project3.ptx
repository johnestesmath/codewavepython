    <title>Project 3: Ceasar Cipher</title>
    
    <p>
        In this project, we will learn to encrypt and decrypt secrete messages with a Ceasare Cipher. 
        A Ceasar Cipher maps the letters of the alphabet to different letters. For example,
        take the message 'Hello World' and a cipher code of 3, we will move each letter down
        3 letters in the alphabet.
    </p> 
    <p>   
        So H -> K, E -> H, L -> 0, and so on. So 'Hello World' is encrypted as 'KHOOR ZRUOG'. If 
        we know the cipher code, we can decrypt it back to 'HELLO WORLD'.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will explain what is going on, but vist <url href="https://www.online-python.com/" visual="online-python.com">Online-Python</url> and type the
        code in for yourself. Once complete, save the file and share with your instructor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keep in mind that program is not linear. Much like writing a story, a poem, or a mathematical proof, we will not
        think of the parts one at a time. We'll try to describe our thought process in the script to share the strategy behind
        writing a program.
