    <title>AI Connecting: Mad-Libs</title>
    
    <p>
        We just completed a project in which you wrote a Mad-Libs game. Hopefully, you wrote a story you
        enjoyed and even played a game or two with a friend. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Now we want to highlight how Large-Language Models (LLMs), an AI tool for language writing, can handle Python scripting.
        Visit <url href="www.chatgpt.com" visual="www.chatgpt.com"/> ChatGPT </url> and ask ChatGPT "Write a Python script for a mad-libs game".
        Compare ChatGPT's code with what you provided.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ask yourself: 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    How similar is the code I wrote versus ChatGPTs?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Are there things ChatGPT did that are different? Do I understand what it wrote?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Can (or should) I use ChatGPT to write code?
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

    </p>

    <p>
        For the last question, we recommend the following tip:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If you cannot write it yourself, do not ask ChatGPT (or any other AI) to do it.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>

    We recommend this strategy for several reason. Firstly, you cannot verify code that you cannot do yourself, and it is not
        uncommon for LLMs to make coding errors. Secondly, you are trying to learn how to code, so how will you actually learn something
        if you are outsourcing all of the work. Thirdly, just like exercising your body to become a better athlete, writing code (and making
        mistakes) and putting in the "hard yards" is what will actually make you a better coder.
    </p>

    <p>
        You do not want to rely on AI so much that it's the only tool you've got. That is a sad and dangerous place to find yourself as a 
        budding coder. Nonetheless, LLMs like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly helpful in programming circles.
