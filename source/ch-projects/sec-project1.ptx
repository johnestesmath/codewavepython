    <title>Project 1: Rock, Paper, and Scissors</title>
    
    <p>
        In this project, we will build a game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors against a Bot. Here's the code in full.

    <p>
        We will explain what is going on, but vist <url href="https://www.online-python.com/" visual="online-python.com">Online-Python</url> and type the
        code in for yourself. Once complete, save the file and share with your instructor.
